# My-Portfolio2.0

The purpose of this project is to talk about me and my background. The webpage is similar to the mock-up (confirmed by tutor it can be a little different)
Code is from scratch using HTML and CSS tools.

The portfolio includes:

- My name
- My Avatar
- Links to my deployed work
- A Responsive layout

Below is a brief description of the user story: 
" AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position" 

Below is a rough screenshot of the page:
