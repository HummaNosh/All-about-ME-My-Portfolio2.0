# My-Portfolio2.0

The purpose of this project is to talk about me, some fun facts, my background and ways to contact me. The webpage is similar to the mock-up (confirmed by tutor it can be a little different)
Code is from scratch using HTML and CSS tools.

The portfolio includes:

- My name
- My Avatar
- Links to my deployed work
- A Responsive layout

Below is a brief description of the user story: 
" AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position" 

Below is the criteria:
- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
- WHEN I load their portfolio
- THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
- THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
- THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
- THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- WHEN I click on the images of the applications
- THEN I am taken to that deployed application
- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
- THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

Below is a rough screenshot of the page:
